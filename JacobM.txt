Things that describe me are: active, religious and family oriented!

One of my hobbies is rockclimbing 
and a rockclimbing gym was the place of my employment 
until the start of this class. 
I climb roughly 3-4 times a week. 
Climbing is a lot harder than most people think.
I have talked to friends and their comments 
about going to an indoor rockclimbing gym were, 
"thats so easy" or "is that even a gym?". 
But let me tell you it is far harder than you would expect.
